<pre>
Bash is great,
long live bash!
and the only way to do that is with active contrib, and innovations. 
or maybe just add some features I like the sound of.

Based on version 5.3.0

MODS:
============
cd -N :: change dir by N directories.
      $cd -3  # go up 3 directories.
      $cd -0  # no operation
      $cd -2  # go up 2 direcotries
  Goal save some key strokes? avoid this: cd ../../../../ type of thing. 
       scripting possibilities?





Introduction
============

This is GNU Bash, version 5.3. Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne
Again SHell, a complete implementation of the POSIX shell spec,
but also with interactive command line editing, job control on
architectures that support it, csh-like features such as history
substitution and brace expansion, and a slew of other features. 
For more information on the features of Bash that are new to this
type of shell, see the file `doc/bashref.info'.  There is also a
large Unix-style man page. If the info fie and the man page conflict,
the man page is the definitive description of the shell's features. 

See the file POSIX for a discussion of how the Bash defaults differ
from the POSIX spec and a description of the Bash `posix mode'.

There are some user-visible incompatibilities between this version
of Bash and previous widely-distributed versions, bash-5.0, bash-5.1,
and bash-5.2. The COMPAT file has the details. The NEWS file tersely
lists features that are new in this release.
